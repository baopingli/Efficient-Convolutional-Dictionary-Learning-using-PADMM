This repository contains the implementation code for paper:

Efficient convolutional dictionary learning using preconditioned ADMM

## Overview

In this work, we proposed to diagonally precondition the system matrices in the filter learning sub-problem of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) problem. 

## Requirements

- matlab2016a

## Run

run `learn_kernels_2D.m`

## Contact

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us through email (baoping_li@qq.com) or Github issues.

This repository will be constantly updated.
