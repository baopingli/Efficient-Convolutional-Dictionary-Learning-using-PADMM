This repository contains the implementation code for paper:

Efficient convolutional dictionary learning using preconditioned ADMM

## Overview

In this work, we proposed to diagonally precondition the system matrices in the filter learning sub-problem of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) problem. 

## Requirements

- matlab2016a

## Acknowledgements

This code is partly based on the open-source implementations from the following sources: [Fast and Flexible Convolutional Sparse Coding](https://github.com/baopingli/FFCSC2015).
